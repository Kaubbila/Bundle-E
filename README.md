## Use Github Pages and use markdown language syntax (not HTML) to create a basic static website:
### Website must be public
* Use at least handful of Github flavour markdown features to format the web page
* Document your work progress with few screenshots to the learning diary
* Write the Github page address to the learning diary so that your peer reviewers can verify it easily
* Keep the pages available until you have received your course grade
